# A-blog-developed-in-Flask
In this repository, I'm going to develope a mini blog with Flask. It will have the following characteristic:
- There are two types of users: Administrator and guests.
- An administrator can add, modify and delete blog entries.
- The guests can register on the blog to comment on the diferent entries.
- An administator can list and delete users, in addition to being able to assign them the administrator role.
These will be the requirements that we will start with. Throughout the proyect, new requirements and functionalities will be added.
